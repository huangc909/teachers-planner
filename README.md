## Planning Experience
As a former art teacher, I've experienced the many to-dos teachers need to complete daily, weekly, and monthly in order to ensure an organized and productive school year. Although classroom and special area teachers have slightly different tasks, there is always something that needs to be done.

I wanted to create a planner so that teachers can more easily organize their daily to-do tasks. When I was an art teacher, I taught at least 30 classes a week, which consisted of over 600 students. Keeping track of all 600+ students' progress, grades, and artworks as well as each class's lesson plans required efficient and strategic organization and planning.

With the Teacher's Planner, teachers can keep a running list of daily tasks as well as store notes and reminders about each task. Although every task may seem important, some are more urgent than others and need to be completed right away. Teachers will be able to indicate which task is considered a priority and view it in their lists. Having the due date included will help teachers break down bigger tasks into smaller tasks. Finally, being able to check off a task will provide teachers the much needed satisfaction of completion especially during a busy day.
